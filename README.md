Requires the Royalty Expansion for Rimworld.

Adds a collection of 11 new psycasts to the Rimworld Royalty Expansion. These new abilities can be granted by upgrading a psychic amplifier and by obtaining the appropriate psytrainer through quest rewards or trading

These extra psycasts include

- Accelerate healing (Rank 1 psycast). Increases the rate at which a target's injuries heal and the rate infection immunity is gained.
- Pyrokinesis (Rank 1 psycast). Starts a small fire at a target location. Does not require line of sight.
